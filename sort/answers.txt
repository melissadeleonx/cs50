How do you know?: After conducting the timing tests, Sort 2 shows fast user time which
                corresponds with the characteristics of a Merge Sort. Aside from its efficiency, the
                time difference between real and sys time are also very minimal and the timings are also
                consistent during the other tests with larger files.
