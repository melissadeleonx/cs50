sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Going back to the charateristics of the Bubble Sort Algorithm, we can see on the running time
                of the program becomes slower with larger files. We can also note taht here is only a very
                small time difference between running the unsorted and sorted files. The sorted files is actually
                faster since the files(arrays) are already sorted.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: After conducting the timing tests, Sort 2 shows fast user time which
                corresponds with the characteristics of a Merge Sort. Aside from its efficiency, I also
                observed that the time difference between real and sys time are very minimal. The timings are
                consistent during the other tests with larger files too.
