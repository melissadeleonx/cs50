How do you know?: After conducting the timing tests, Sort 2 shows fast user time which
                corresponds with the characteristics of a Merge Sort. Aside from its efficiency, I also
                observed that the time difference between real and sys time are very minimal.  the timings are also
                consistent during the other tests with larger files.
