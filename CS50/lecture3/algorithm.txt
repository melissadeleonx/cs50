Algorithms - Computer memory sees the data as closed door and it is up to the programmer
to make s that is easier to be read by the computer.

Arrays are zero indexed, the data start counting from [0] from left to right.

Searching and finding the information.
input -> algorithm -> output

Compare which algorithm is better. Correct is already given but programs should be well designed, sophisticated,
not confusing, nonredundant, the quality of the code and the performance.

Algorithm is correlated with their running times, the time consumed when it is run.
big O = order of such and such, should be faster and efficient

log2(n) - dive and conquer strategy, solving smaller parts to bigger parts at a time, faster and more
effective.
