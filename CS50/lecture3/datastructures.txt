Arrays are lightweighted data structures which allow variables to run back to back to back
We can invent our own data types whether 2 dimensional, 3 dimensional or beyond
With C, we can create our own type with our names

For example, we can make a data type called person and the variable people. We can use the primitive functions to implement it.
person people[]
In previous example when doing a phonebook, we used two datatypes, string name and string number. We can actually combine to structured the data more sophisticatedly.

In scratch, we see that we can also do the same and define the new functions.
To define the data structure of the new data type, we use the key. It is like making a data structure with multiple values
typedef struct
{
    string name;
    string number;
}
person;
After the semi colon, it means that any syntax after that can access the person data type. The new definition of tjhe
new data structure is usually indicated above main
