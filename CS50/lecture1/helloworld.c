    // Things to remember: correctness, design, well formulated, how well-structured
    // It should not be messy, organised for you and the next person, focus on designing codes, efficient, clean and pretty
    // Capitalization, start getting into a habbit - correctness, design, style
    // From codes to 0 and 1 - from source code to machine codes(input-->algorithm(compiler)-->output) using a COMPILER
    // The file is in .c in that language of C!!
    // stdio.h are libraries
    // Automating things with keyboard is better than pointing with mouse, rm for remove(you can always make again, executable), ls for list

    // What is a terminal window? interact with a computer, gives ability to run a command
    // $ has nothing to do with currency, it is just there to start writing the command line interface
    // Programming(writing the code(GUI) --> Running (using the terminal(CLI))
    // Make means compiling, keeps making a new version, overwriting the original - yes make is not automatic, you need to implement it in the real compiler 'alias'(took me 1 day to figure out!!)
    // printf - F means formatted; in C, multiple
    // argument - functions - side effects (ex. hello world -> say -> hello world!) - return values, variables(answer like get_string)
