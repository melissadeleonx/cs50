Data types in Python do not need to be explicitly declared. For example, you saw how answer above is a string, but we did not have to tell the interpreter this was the case: It knew on its own.
In Python, commonly used types include:

  bool
  float
  int
  str

Notice that long and double are missing. Python will handle what data type should be used for larger and smaller numbers.
Some other data types in Python include:

  range
  list
  tuple
  dict
  set
Each of these data types can be implemented in C, but in Python they can be implemented more simply.

As with C, the CS50 library can be utilized within Python.
The following functions will be of particular use:

  get_float
  get_int
  get_string
You also have the option of importing only specific functions from the CS50 library as follows:

from CS50 import get_float, get_int, get_string

CONDITIONALS
Notice that there are no more curly braces. Instead, indentations are utilized. Second, a colon is utilized in the if statement. Further, elif replaces else if. Parentheses are also no longer required in the if and elif statements.

Variable declaration is simplified too. In C, you might have int counter = 1;. In Python, this same line would read counter = 1. You need not declare the type of the variable.
Python favors counter += 1 to increment by one, losing the ability found in C to type counter++.


Loops in Python are very similar to C. You may recall the following code in C:
