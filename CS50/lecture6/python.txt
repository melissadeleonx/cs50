Data types in Python do not need to be explicitly declared. For example, you saw how answer above is a string, but we did not have to tell the interpreter this was the case: It knew on its own.
In Python, commonly used types include:

  bool
  float
  int
  str

Notice that long and double are missing. Python will handle what data type should be used for larger and smaller numbers.
Some other data types in Python include:

  range
  list
  tuple
  dict
  set
Each of these data types can be implemented in C, but in Python they can be implemented more simply.
