// Step 1: Make a pseudocode
// Goal: Determine how long it takes for a population to reach a particular size.
int main(void)
{
    // Prompt the user for a starting population size

    // Step 2: Make a condition with this rule: If the user enters a number less than 9 (the minimum allowed population size), the user should be re-prompted to enter a starting population size until they enter a number that is greater than or equal to 9. (If we start with fewer than 9 llamas, the population of llamas will quickly become stagnant!)

    // Prompt the user for an ending population size

    // Step 3: Make a condition with thsi rule: If the user enters a number less than the starting population size, the user should be re-prompted to enter an ending population size until they enter a number that is greater than or equal to the starting population size. (After all, we want the population of llamas to grow!)
