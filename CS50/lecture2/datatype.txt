How large each of the data types is?
bool 1 byte(8 bits) - actually it should only be 1 bit for True(1) and Fales(0) but the computer standardazied it to 8 bits
char 1 byte - as in ASCII (numbers, letters, symbols etc.)
double  8 bytes
float 4 bytes
int 4 bytes
long 8 bytes
string ? bytes (sets of chars)
