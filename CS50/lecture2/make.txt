make is an automated command implemented by CS50 staff
-->
* This is another way
CS50/lecture2/ $ clang clang.c
CS50/lecture2/ $ ls
a.out*  clang.c  make.txt
CS50/lecture2/ $ ./a.out
Hello World!

* Another way of exploring what is under the hood. I also tried the VSCode on Desktop using the Make Extension and took me 1 day to figure it out
clang -o clang clang.c
CS50/lecture2/ $ ls
a.out*  clang*  clang.c  make.txt
./clang
Hello World!

* I will try to procedure on my VSCODE, I am okay with gcc, it is a bit complicated

Watch on phone, notes tomorrow
