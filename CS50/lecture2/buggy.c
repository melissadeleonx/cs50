// Debugging Exercises - I corrected the bug manually but let's see what other procedure can we follow by putting < 3 and separating # from \n
// Use printf to detect the bug, it is pretty cool to see the i(counter times)
// How debugger works, you can use for now debug50 - compile first before debugging and make sure to put a breakpoint on the line you want to debug. There are other parts of the debugger like Step In Step Out etc.
// What is the alternative for debug50??
// Best debugger method is talking to someone or your imaginary companion. Works magic! I did it for the brick problems!
