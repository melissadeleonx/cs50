compiling --> actually means doing 4 things all at once
1. preprocessing - notice the first section of the code, there is the command #include, technically it is called
                preprocessor directives, handled special than the rest of the codes.
                For prototype functions that we make, we declare its existence before the main and add its definition somewhere at the bottom of the code
                e.g. Inside the cs50. h library, there is a specific function that we always use in this course, it is the get_string function
                The get_string function is defined like this for example:
                string get_string(string prompt); - this line is added before main
                string get_string(string prompt){its definition} is added somewhere on the code, telling the computer that it exists and we will implement it somehow
                In stdio.h, the prototype for printf is int printf(string format. . .) - more complicated than we think
                
2. compiling
3. assembling
4. linking
