compiling --> actually means doing 4 things all at once
1. preprocessing - notice the first section of the code, there is the command #include, technically it is called
                preprocessor directives, handled special than the rest of the codes.
                For prototype functions that we make, we declare its existence before the main and add its definition somewhere at the bottom of the code
                
2. compiling
3. assembling
4. linking
